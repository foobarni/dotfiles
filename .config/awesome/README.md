# My Awful Config

This config is in a functional status. It runs without errors. It is using the gtk theme that comes with awesome.

### Notices:
- Some systray icons such as the *volumeicon* or *udiskie* behave differently.
- Similarly, the taskbar icons are not resolution independent.
- The above problems occured when I switched from awesome to awesome-git, and also experimented with its implementation into the xfce4 desktop environment.

I am considering rewriting the config in a modular way as documented [here](http://epsi-rns.github.io/desktop/2019/06/15/awesome-overview.html).
It would help me understand the code components better and it would make it easier to swap features in and out, without the need to add or remove big chunks of code.
