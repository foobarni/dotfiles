# Welcome to my ~/

This is the repository of my dotfiles. The `main` branch carries my stable configs. Occasionally, I store my ongoing fiddling process through a `tweak` branch.

I am tracking my dotfiles using the [bare repository and alias method](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles#Tracking_dotfiles_directly_with_Git).
The configurations are optimized for my Arch Linux systems, so use them at your own risk.

---

All the configurations follow the programs' wiki or installation guides, either from their official website, GitHub or the Arch wiki. Therefore, the files are located where the programs expect them to be, and the repository's file hierarchy reflects the locations.

My main goal is to use packages from the Arch Linux official repositories available via pacman, to minimize package maintenance and possible conflicts that could occur when using multiple sources.
I don't use AUR helpers, but install packages manually.
